# these settings are path-dependent.
# it's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix.
# for example, "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2".
# for example, "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
# the settings under the path "all" are applied to all paths that do not match
# another entry.

    # url of the source stream, in the format rtsp://user:pass@host:port/path
